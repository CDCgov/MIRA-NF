# MIRA's Find Variants of Interest Tool

The **find_variants_of_int** workflow is a handy tool that runs (or reruns) DAIS-ribosome and the find_variants_of_interest module. To get started, you'll need to provide the DAIS-ribosome input, a reference table, and a variants of interest table. Once it's done, you'll get a CSV file that lists all the positions in your input sequences that match the variants you're interested in from the variants of interest table you provided. Check out the info below for more details about how it works.

*find_variants_of_int workflow*

### The DAIS-ribosome input

The input file for this workflow is a concatenated FASTA file with assembled sequences from all of your samples. If you've run the MIRA pipeline, you'll find this input file named DAIS_ribosome_input.fasta in the dais-ribosome folder within the aggregate outputs.

### The reference table input should be structured like this:
The reference table can be made by running your reference genomes through DAIS-ribosome and selecting the column found below. The file needs to be tab delimited. An example using Flu genomes can be seens below.

```
isolate_id	isolate_name	subtype	passage_history	nt_id	ctype	reference_id	protein	aa_aln	cds_aln

```

### The known variants of interest table input should be structured like this:
The variants of interest table should be structured as seen below. These should be variants you would be interested in if they were present within your samples. The file must be tab delimited.

```
protein position    mutation_of_int phenotypic_consensus

HA	8	Q	 inference description
HA	94	N	inference description
HA	121	N	inference description
